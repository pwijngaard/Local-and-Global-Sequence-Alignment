# Local-and-Global-Sequence-Alignment
Written for a school project, this is a program that makes sequence alignments with amino acids. For a global sequence it uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and for a local sequence alignment it uses the Smith-Waterman algorithm. 

This repository contains:

main.py: The file containing the code of the program.

PAM250.txt: The PAM250 scoring matrix.

BLOSUM62.txt: The BLOSUM62 scoring matrix.

Shot.txt: The FASTA protein sequence for D. melanogaster Shot

hACF7.txt: The FASTA protein sequence for human ACF7.

BIO 131 Final Wijngaard Report.pdf: A detailed explanation of the program, its intended applications and its shortcomings.
